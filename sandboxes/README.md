# Reactime End-to-End Testing

This folder contains automated tests as well as manual tests. The automated Jest / Puppeteer tests can be run by issuing the npm test command from within the root of the automated-tests directory.

Manual tests have been created for both Concurrent Mode and NextJS. These sandboxes can be launched manually by issuing the npm start command from within either of these directories. They can also be automated by using the same logic used for automated testing.
